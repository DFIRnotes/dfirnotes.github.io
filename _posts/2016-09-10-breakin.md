Breakin' into Security: Some InfoSec career tips

_How we can both get more out of your next job interview_


Below is a dump of the text from the slides, complete but not so pretty.

```
 about:
disclaimers of warranty, introspection
 Disclaimers, background
I am not:
*  a Manager
*  recruiting or hiring today
* 
I have interviewed hundreds for sec,tech jobs these last few years.
â No need to raise your hands.
Most interviews are painful experiences for all.
â Yes, even the phone screens.
â Ask my cube mates.
Less than 5% of those people were hired by us.
â That sucks.
I'm also not a
*  licensed counselor
*  therapist * 
*  lawyer
*  or LE *cough*

 self.inspect
*  I'm on my third full time security job, now a Lead Security Engineer with a big firm.
*  Iâm a sysadmin, incident responder, and intrusion analyst
*  and I teach for SANS part-time as a Community Instructor
*  BBST, CISSP, GCFA, GCIA, GCIH, GMON, GNFA, GSEC, LPIC-1, ITILF ...
*  Find me around as @dfirnotes on Twitter,GitHub or http://adric.net
 factoids

some axioms to start us off
 Are there jobs? Absolutely, but:
*  Not many "entry level" infosec jobs. â All require some skills and experience.
â often IT or programming skills
â  but not always: Audit, Intel, SocialEng, LE, law ... *  Josh Moore: You can go for an existing job
â or make one for yourself (Job Reconn book).
*  Job, Profession, Career, Affliction, Hobby?
â What do you have, where are you, and where are you going?
 âWords, they mean stuffâ
*  Information Security:
â Keeping DAD away from the CIA â  from your GSEC or CISSP books
â Red team vs Blue team, or NSM
â GigOps, CNA, CND, CNE for the milspec nerds
*  Cyber?
â Why we've barely met!
â Srsly be careful with this word #{self.drink!}
*  Hackers, Crackers, skidiots, Journalists
â Powerful words have meaning in context
â  social context, technical context, cultural, professional ...
â  cf: connotation vs. denotation

 Requirements
get these things to win
 Don't bother HR if you don't have these things solid:
*  Communicate well
â cover mail
â on phone
â in person!
*  Be awesome at what you currently do
â (whatever it is)
*  Resume / CV with no lies in it
*  Portfolio of sample work, achievements
âWords, they mean stuffâ
- some awesome guy
*  Not lying.
âWhenever ... be awesome instead.â - Barney in HIMYM
