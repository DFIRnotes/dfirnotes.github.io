Look up what you need to … but not too much

Mark hard questions ... but only a few

Manage your time … don't run out

Make best use of Practice Exams!

Study, Test, Study, Test, Test
Recommended cycle 

 Finish (some) studies first
	Read books, listen to podcast, watch videos
 Simulate your exam conditions
	Take practice exam #1 seriously:
