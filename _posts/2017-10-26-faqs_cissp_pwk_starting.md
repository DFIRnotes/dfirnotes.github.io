Some good FAQs from mailbox

CISSP
---

CISSP exam prep? This really depends on how good your grasp on the material in the 7
domains is.

* If you know the domains but want help studying for the test: 
  * Eric Conrad's 11th Hour Study Guide book

* If you need to study some of the domains: 
    * Shon Harris (dec) or even
    * the ISC^2 material

* Practice tests and quizzes are very helpful, some in books and check
https://www.freepracticetests.org/quiz/index.php from CCCure

PWK

Pen Testing with Kali and OSCP ?

* The book / lab tutorials really will expose you to everything you need
for the practice labs.

* Self-guided study and practice of that material, and resources for
those topics is essential.

* e.g. for Buffer Overflows and other exploitation I would recommend
    * Hacking: The Art of Exploitation (2nd Ed)

* Python programming is one of many things you will learn as part of PWK
if you don't know it.

* There are many writeups and reviews. This is my favourite, including
the comments:

OSCP

I can't really add anything about OSCP as I haven't tried for it yet. I
may be trying PWK and OSCP again in 2018 depending on where work takes me.

Getting started?

For getting started in infosec there's a lot of material available. I
did a long talk on it a couple times ... 

Try Leslie's site for some good insights: https://tisiphone.net/

Brian Krebs did a big series of interviews on it that are a great read:
https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/how-to-break-into-security/

Chris Sanders' new podcast is actually entirely interviews with infosec
folk about their backgrounds and how they got started so you may get
alot out of that: http://chrissanders.org/podcast/
