Herein are a few notes on my prepping to renew my GSE as traditionally made and posted before taking the exam. I'll be taking the [renewal](https://www.giac.org/certification/security-expert-gse#maintenance) exam shortly and won't be able to comment about it. For my backstory try my previous GSE study [post](http://www.dfirnotes.net/gse-study-list/) (2017) and for more info on [GSE](https://www.giac.org/certification/security-expert-gse) see the official site: https://giac.org/gse .

## study plan
I did shortlist some studying and prioritise it these few months, pretty succesfully.
### Core Course Review
* I listened to, looked at, and did most of the labs and bonus exercises in the renewal package materials:
  * SEC504: "Attacker Techniques, Exploits, and Incident Handling" [syllabus](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/hacker-techniques-exploits-incident-handling/)
  * SEC503: "Intrusion Detection in Depth" [syllabus](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/intrusion-detection-in-depth/)
  * I took GIAC practice exams for GCIH, GSEC, and GCIA.

### Target Practice
* I'm working through the Easy targets in OffSec's Proving Grounds [range](https://www.offensive-security.com/labs/), with much use of hints and walkthroughs. By the scoreboard today I've completed six (and I've probably tried six more that I haven't finished yet / fled from in panic or disgust **cough**).
* light CTF / puzzle practice

## but also
### $dayjob
* I work in SecOps and kinda soak in some of these topics every week, which certainly helps.

### conferences & webinars, other courses
* I've caught some great talks and presentations in 2021 and have positive infinity ( &infinity; ) queued up.
  * **PLUG** Kernel Con 2021 [Hack Live](https://kernelcon.org/) videos are posted and I want to replay them all, to catch what I missed. 
* Summits! http://sans.org/summits
* ibid. positive infinity online classes queued up, oh and college ?

### books I have started reading
* [Purple Team Field Manual](https://purpleteamfieldmanual.com/)
* [Honeypots for Intrusion Detection](https://www.networkdefense.io/library/building-intrusion-detection-honeypots/about/)
* [Red Team Development and Operations: A practical guide](https://redteam.guide/)
