Nearly half-way through a busy year I think I know what I'm working on ... especially after dropping out of college again after trying it again for a couple years.
I'm dividing up my time and attention mostly between the two skillsets that I've used so far and see myself continuing to use at $dayjob and beyond.

## Split-Brain

1. Hacking skills development and practice
1. Technical program and organisational skills
1. languages usw.

### Hacking
* renewed [GSE](https://giac.org/gse) and refreshed a library of SANS courses to go (back) through
  * more top-notch analysis, malware, forensics, and data analytics material than I could work through in any year 
* Red Team Ops [class](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/red-team-exercises-adversary-emulation/), [book](https://redteam.guide/), [labs](https://www.detectionlab.network/) and resulting experiments
* continued grinding at [Proving Grounds](https://www.offensive-security.com/labs/), [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) and perhaps a CTF

### Program Devel
* MGT514 and GSTRT
* select conference talks and workshops, like #PurpleTeamSummit
* more TBD

### elif
* python ?
  * CircuitPython & other [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/) [stuff](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4985)
  * pandas courses, eg from Matt Harrison (Metasnake): https://store.metasnake.com/courses
* gentle pressure on 日本語, ta Hol, Cyril, Hanguel, y otras amigas    
* random operating system and dev tool installs, pretty likely
