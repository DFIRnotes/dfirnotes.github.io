## TIL SEC564 Red Team Ops and Adversary Emulation

Things I learned (TIL) and what I got out of the awesome two days SANS course on Red Team and Adversary Emulation I took online after Purple Team Summit 2021

Course page: [https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/red-team-exercises-adversary-emulation/](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/red-team-exercises-adversary-emulation/)

* huge 2 day brain dump from an experienced operator and leader on effective practices (Thanks @jorgeorchilles !)
* useful definitions and models to distinguish the role of different functions
  * along with Purple Team Summit [Talks](https://www.sans.org/presentations/?&focus-area=purple-team) and [Red Team Guide](https://redteam.guide/) [book](https://redteam.guide/docs/) :
  * distinguish: vuln scan, vuln assessment, pen test, red team, purple team, adversary emulation 
* intelligence driven process model for offensive operations using adversary emulation
    * plus another designed for purple team exercises and programs
* some background and tips on current platforms: Empire (and [Starkiller](https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Starkiller)), Scythe.io, [Vectr.io](https://vectr.io/getting-started/), and Caldera
* a few hours practice on a full chain intrusion scenario (phish, elevate, lateral, exfil)
    * particularly great for me because there were more than one machine I could access
