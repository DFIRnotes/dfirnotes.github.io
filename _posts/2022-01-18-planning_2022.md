Some thoughts and links about some of the things I'm thinking about for professional development and education for the year

## leadership and comms
_$dayjob leader has some ideas about courses and seminars_
* Do more writing/educating/presenting
	* apply to present (CFP)s
	* present & share (brown bags)
	* posts & articles, quick shares
* more / better mentoring 

## furthering knowledge & skills 
_arguably need to pick one or two of areas like:_
* web & app sec / attack & defense
	* [Portswigger](https://portswigger.net/web-security) labs, [Secure Ideas](https://www.secureideas.com/peas) courses
	* &infin; PG/[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)/VulnHub boxes & CTFs
* malware & code analysis
	* replay FOR610/GREM, take new FOR710 code analysis
	* CTFs and tutorials,[OST2](https://p.ost2.fyi/) courses
* more better (fluffier?) DFIR
	* eg [SANS](https://www.sans.org/digital-forensics-incident-response/) new FOR509 (cloud) or FOR608 (enterprise) ?
	* [AND](https://www.networkdefense.io/library/) Threat Hunting / ELK  / Sigma courses
* purple team / offensive ops
	* [MAD](https://mitre-engenuity.org/mad/) Adversary Emulation certification 
	* something other than OSCP
		* TCM [Academy](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/courses/) Ethical Hacking
	* or even [SEC699](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/purple-team-tactics-adversary-emulation/) (after replay SEC599/GDAT)
* deceptions and adv cyber defence
	* Honeypots course (AND) or SANS
	* ACD / Antisyphon [courses](https://www.antisyphontraining.com/active-defense-cyber-deception-w-john-strand/) / labs / webinars

Also, need to reserve time/brainpower for continued understanding of cloud ops/SRE and numerous project/technology specific trainings or familiarisation runs.

**Probably not this year**
* Python / data science , cryptography, ML
* finally get good with ```awk(1)```
* KLCP (either :frowning_woman: )
* Linux or Mac forensics deep-dive

Somewhat inspired by last year's [plan](http://www.dfirnotes.net/study-plan-21/) and the carry bits I'm trying to finish up now.
