_Collecting a number of questions that might be informative to ask in job interviews, for practice and mentoring usage. You probably can't/shouldn't ask all of these, might not get an answer, and "No" isn't bad. Deliberately excluded are most compensation and benefits questions which you should **definitely** ask about. People have different needs and priorities, so getting more information helps everyone make better decisions. Hope this helps!_
