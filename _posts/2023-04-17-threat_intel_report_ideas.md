What would make up the perfect cybersecurity threat intelligence (CTI) report to receive, ingest, automate around? Honestly, even any three of these things makes for a great report. More context and detail are better, if the report author / information sharing organisation can support it.

## Detailed data, using integrated frameworks and CTI data models
* Intrusion (or attempts) detailed (ala Diamond Model) with time and impact 
   * Actor, Victim (and/or Target), Infrastructure, Capability .. plus time and impact :
     * "who tried to do what to whom, when/how often, and did it work" ?
* Activity and any impact detailed and coded, categorised (ala VERIS or DoD 6510 Categories)
* Notable techniques and tactics observed (eg MITRE ATT&CK ids, versions)
* Possible countermeasures and detections in open formats (Suricata, Sigma, Yara, ClamAV) or public reference (Critical Controls, NIST CSF)
* Recommended Actions / Practices public reference (Critical Controls, NIST, etc)
* References & Citations
