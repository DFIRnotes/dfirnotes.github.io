Some thoughts and links about some of the things I'm thinking about for professional development and education for the year

## This looks like an awful lot of courses
* Seminar series and book club from Threat Intel Dot Academy
* review a SANS core course to update and refresh skills
  * which course is TBD
  * probably Netwars run too
* helping with ICS4ICS workforce development
  * maybe complete my first credential there too
* OffSec: PEN-200 this year, starting soon
* DFIR.Training / Brett S. (is back)
* Security Architecture course and certification ($work)
* Investigation Theory (AND) group study ($work)
* Antisyphon course (possibly)

## leadership and comms
_$dayjob leader has some ideas about courses and seminars_
* Do more writing/educating/presenting
	* apply to present (CFP)s
	* present & share (brown bags)
	* posts & articles, quick shares
* more / better mentoring 

Somewhat inspired by previous years' [plans](http://www.dfirnotes.net/planning-22/). Feedback appreciate or just share what you are learning!
