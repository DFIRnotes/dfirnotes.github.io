Here are some thoughts and links about some of the things I'm thinking about for professional development and education for the year.
**Update 1** in early July with some details and "how it's going".
**Update 2** in early Oct with more details and "how it's going".

## This looks like an awful lot of courses
* Seminar series and book club from Threat Intel Dot Academy (a few lectures behind)
* review a SANS core course to update and refresh skills
  * FOR508: Advanced Incident Response, Threat Hunting, and Digital Forensics (August .. Oct) [TIL 508 post](https://www.dfirnotes.net/til_for508_review_2024/)
  * probably DFIR Netwars run too, and DFIR Summit [TIL](https://www.dfirnotes.net/til_dfirsummit_2024/)
* helped a tiny with ICS4ICS workforce development
  * got my first credential there 3Q
* OffSec: PEN-200 this year, started ...
* DFIR.Training / Brett S. (is back): Placing Suspects Behind the Keyboard V2 (ondemand, more to do)
* SANS Security Architecture/ZT course and certification: GCDA ($work) (May .. July 2024)
* Investigation Theory (AND) group study ($work) (May .. July)
* Antisyphon/MetaCTF range time: ACE-Tâ„¢ Level 7 [permalink](https://lookup.hackhills.com/?id=1457880)

## leadership and comms, too ?
_$dayjob leader has some ideas about courses and seminars_
* Do more writing/educating/presenting
  * apply to present (CFP)s: accepted & presented at B-Sides Atlanta 2024:
    * [How Not ... talk links](https://www.dfirnotes.net/hownot_links/)	
  * present & share at $work (brown bags)
  * posts & articles, quick shares
* more / better mentoring 

Somewhat inspired by previous years' [plans](http://www.dfirnotes.net/planning-22/). Feedback appreciated or just share what you are learning!
