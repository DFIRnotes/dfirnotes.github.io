Here are some thoughts and links about some of the things I'm thinking about for professional development and education for the year.
**Updated** post in early July with some details and "how it's going".

## This looks like an awful lot of courses
* Seminar series and book club from Threat Intel Dot Academy (a few lectures behind)
* review a SANS core course to update and refresh skills
  * ICS515: ICS Visibility, Detection, and Response (August)
  * probably DFIR Netwars run too
* helped a tiny with ICS4ICS workforce development
  * applied for my first credential there 2Q
* OffSec: PEN-200 this year, started ...
* DFIR.Training / Brett S. (is back): Placing Suspects Behind the Keyboard V2 (July)
* SANS Security Architecture/ZT course and certification ($work) (ETA: July 2024)
* Investigation Theory (AND) group study ($work) (through July)
* Antisyphon range time / ACE-Tâ„¢ Level 5 

## leadership and comms, too ?
_$dayjob leader has some ideas about courses and seminars_
* Do more writing/educating/presenting
	* apply to present (CFP)s
	* present & share (brown bags)
	* posts & articles, quick shares
* more / better mentoring 

Somewhat inspired by previous years' [plans](http://www.dfirnotes.net/planning-22/). Feedback appreciate or just share what you are learning!
