TIL DFIR Summit 2024 online

* two tracks, so had to make choices about which talks to see live, most were recorded
  * videos and slides will posted as soon as they can

* amazing, scary case reviews and new analysis tools released
  * Great new talk and expansion of Strelka: Strelka-UI (from Target)
  * Fascinating early release of LLAMA file analysis framework (from SF)
  * a good talk and chat discussions about bringing new people into DFIR 
  * detailed, practical talk about imaging and getting data from modern Macs
  * technical talk on Ghidra automation using GameBoy games as example data
  * a discussion of three (or more) supply chain intrusions by Taiwanese responders
  * a review and discussion of crisis communication and it's impact on incident response (and organisations overall)
* one keynote, didn't like it at all (unfortunate "AI" hype mixed with philosophy and politics => advice that concerned me).
