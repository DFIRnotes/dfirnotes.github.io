_Herein are some books, articles, and people that we read, skimmed, or thought fondly of while preparing the "How Not to Have a Bad Time with Risky Data" talk seen at B-Sides Atlanta 2024_

Slides PDF for browsing is [here](https://github.com/DFIRnotes/rules/blob/master/hownot_bsidesatl24.pdf), source in the Rules [repo](https://github.com/DFIRnotes/rules). This talk was not recorded, so no video is available at this time.
