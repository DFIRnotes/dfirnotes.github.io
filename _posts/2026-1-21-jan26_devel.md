1. "Rethinking Trust and Leadership" Rachel Botsman, seminar hosted by ISACA
1. We're moving! Blog hosting updates soon, but DNS willing y'all won't notice anything.
1. I'm counting this: writing up and posting this update. :smiling_cat:

## ACTI
* live online course delivered over five days
* focused on direct application of CTI work to impactful security decisions
* insight into effective uses of CTI tools like:
  * MITRE ATT&CK frameworks, Diamond Model, and intrusion life cycles
  * observables enrichment and sharing to drive behavioural analysis and patterning
  * putting tactical and strategic TI into your organisation's context
* fantastic, focused, useful: take it yourself or with your whole team before more extensive and expensive CTI courses

## 2026 Cybersecurity Career Blueprint
* live workshop for career strategy and planning
* take it live and work through the sheet with Taylor (or replay later)
* uses strategic planning, task design, and habit formation skills from many great books and thinkers applied to cybersecurity roles and skills
* excellent, and I need to follow through on the next steps
* found via newsletter, ping me for for more info (link TBD)

## Rethinking Trust and Leadership
* ISACA hosted webinar with author presentation and then Q&A
* thoughtful and provocative discussion on the differences and balance between risk and trust in leadership and decision making
* illustrated with evocative anecdotes from familiar orgs and brands
* aware of and inclusive of the chaotic times we live and work in
* simple, clear, slides focused on key points of each section
* absolutely worth the time, ISACA annual dues (or the nominal fee) and the series continues to show ISACA as a useful source for learning
